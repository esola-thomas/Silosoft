# Silosoft Enhancements Summary

This document captures the incremental UX, accessibility, architecture, and developer-experience enhancements added beyond the original core mechanics (Tasks T001–T075).

## Real-Time & State Management
- WebSocket push channel broadcasting a unified state snapshot after mutating actions (draw, complete, pass, etc.).
- Fallback polling auto-suspends while a healthy socket connection is active to reduce network overhead.
- Centralized state serialization reused by REST and WS, ensuring consistent client view.

## UI / UX Features
- Multi-theme system: Dark (default), Light, High-Contrast; persistent across sessions.
- Reduced-Motion control (system / on / off) affecting animations & transitions for accessibility.
- Orientation Hint overlay: Guides users to rotate or widen when in narrow portrait; dismiss persisted per session.
- Feature Focus Mode: Dims non-active player cards to emphasize the current turn's context.
- Action Dock Pin: Allows users to pin the hand/action panel fixed at the bottom across viewport sizes.
- Container Query Density: Player card layout adapts chip sizes and spacing based on available container width.
- Toast Notification System: Non-blocking success/error/status feedback with accessible live region.

## Interaction & Flow Improvements
- Unified action buttons (Draw / Complete / Pass) located in polished Hand Panel (removed duplicate unstyled bar).
- Completion dialog enriched with per-role Need/Have/Deficit and contractor feasibility.
- Contractors act as 2‑point wildcards filling any role deficits with minimal penalty tracking.
- Focused snapshot updates reduce UI churn by limiting manual refresh logic.

## Accessibility
- High-Contrast theme ensuring strong luminance contrast for text/icons.
- Reduced-motion compliance (prefers-reduced-motion media query + manual override).
- Semantic live region for toasts (`role="status"`, `aria-live="polite"`).
- Toggle buttons expose pressed state via `aria-pressed` (Focus Mode, Dock Pin).
- Buttons labeled for screen readers; removal of redundant aria-labels that masked visible names in tests.

## Code & Architecture Enhancements
- State snapshot function shared between REST and WebSocket layers to prevent drift.
- Context reducer extended with WebSocket connection status, focus mode, dock pin preferences.
- LocalStorage / SessionStorage used judiciously (theme, motion preference, dock pin, orientation hint dismiss) with safe fallbacks.
- Container queries adopted for future-proof responsive scaling instead of complex breakpoint proliferation.

## Documentation & Dev Experience
- README updated with real-time sync description, theming, motion, focus, dock, orientation hint, and container query notes.
- Enhancements separated here for concise change review and onboarding.

## Potential Future Extensions
- Spectator / observer read-only mode (join without player seat, full board visibility).
- Server persistence for multi-game sessions and reconnect/resume flows.
- Rich event rendering (iconography + inline resolution history per player).
- Trade modal integration and negotiation history timeline.
- Advanced contractor economics (graduated penalty or scarcity pricing).
- AI assistant suggestions for optimal resource bundling or trade offers.
- Replay viewer with turn-by-turn scrub and diff highlighting.
- Export/import deterministic game seeds + serialized RNG position for mid-game share.
- Pluggable scoring variants (e.g., bonus for completing without contractors, streak multipliers).

## Changelog Snapshot (Key Items)
1. WebSocket broadcast + serializer abstraction.
2. Toast system with stack & auto-dismiss.
3. Theme cycle (dark/light/high-contrast) persistence.
4. Reduced-motion system (system/on/off) with global animation suppression.
5. Orientation hint overlay (session dismiss).
6. Feature Focus Mode (dim non-active players).
7. Action Dock pin (persistent preference).
8. Container queries for players strip density.
9. Unification of action controls in Hand Panel.
10. README and structured enhancements documentation.

## Acceptance Criteria Coverage
- All UX toggles visibly update state & persist where appropriate.
- Tests pass after action control unification (completion flow preserved).
- No duplicate action trigger elements remain.
- Accessibility affordances (aria-pressed, motion reduction) function without runtime errors.
