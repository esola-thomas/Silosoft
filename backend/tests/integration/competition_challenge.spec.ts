/**
 * New Integration: Competition challenge enforcement
 * Flow:
 * 1. Start seeded game where we will force a competition event by manipulating draws (future improvement) or looping until occurs.
 * 2. Once challenge set, skip (pass) the next turn without completing => expect penalty applied: either feature removed or resources discarded.
 * 3. Validate log contains penalty message and challenge cleared.
