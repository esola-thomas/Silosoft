## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
All prior ambiguities have been resolved; decisions are documented in the Resolved Design Decisions section.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a team of players, we want to cooperatively complete a target number of feature cards within a fixed number of turns, by drawing resources, mitigating events, and strategically trading so that we achieve an instant team victory before the turn limit expires.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new game with X players and each holding an initial active feature and 3 resource cards, **When** the first player starts their turn and draws a resource (per weighted draw) **Then** the resource is added to their hand and they may take actions (trade, attempt completion, pass).
2. **Given** a player draws an Event card "Layoff" with at least one resource in hand, **When** the event resolves, **Then** exactly one resource is removed at random from that player's hand and the turn proceeds.
3. **Given** a player has sufficient role points in hand to meet all role thresholds on their active feature, **When** they choose to complete the feature, **Then** the required resources are expended simultaneously, the feature counts toward the team total, and a replacement feature is immediately drawn if within the turn limit.
4. **Given** the team reaches (playerCount * 3) completed features on any completion before or during turn 10, **When** that completion is processed, **Then** the game ends immediately with a team win.
5. **Given** turn 10 ends without reaching the target number of completed features, **When** the end-of-turn check runs, **Then** the game ends in a loss.
6. **Given** a player is under a Company Competition requirement set on the prior turn, **When** they fail to complete any feature during their next turn, **Then** the defined penalty (feature forfeiture or resource discard if none) is applied at turn end.
7. **Given** a resource is marked PTO, **When** the owning player attempts to include it in a completion bundle before it becomes available, **Then** the system prevents its selection.
8. **Given** a player initiates one trade in a turn, **When** they attempt to initiate a second trade in the same turn, **Then** the action is disallowed (recipient participation as non-initiator does not count against their initiation limit).

### Edge Cases
- Drawing an event when the player's hand is empty (Layoff / Reorg / PTO) ‚Üí event nullifies without side effects.
- Company Competition penalty when player has zero completed features ‚Üí resource discard fallback triggers. [Confirm exact number of discards if insufficient resources.]
- Multiple possible completion bundles in hand ‚Üí player selects one; excess points are ignored.
- Attempted completion with over-satisfaction on a role (e.g., need 2, have 5) ‚Üí allowed; excess has no carryover.
- Turn 10 instant win vs. loss race: if win threshold reached during any action of turn 10, game ends immediately as win before loss condition checks.
- Contractor wildcard role declaration must be atomic with completion decision; cannot count for multiple roles simultaneously.
- PTO resource expiring exactly at end of owner's next turn becomes usable on following turn start.
- Trading PTO-marked resources: PTO-locked resources may be traded; their lock persists for the recipient.
- Simultaneous competition and PTO interactions: PTO lock does not waive competition requirement; player may still fail and incur penalty.
- No available new feature card at completion (feature list exhausted) ‚Üí Player simply has no active feature; game continues (victory still possible through other players). No early termination.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The game MUST support 1‚Äì4 players configurable at game start.
- **FR-002**: Each player MUST begin with exactly one active feature card and exactly three resource cards.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST enforce a global turn limit of 10 turns where a "turn" = one player's complete sequence.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST track and display the team target = playerCount * 3 completed features.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST end the game immediately in victory upon reaching or exceeding the target within the turn limit.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST end the game in loss immediately after the 10th turn ends if the target was not reached.
- **FR-007**: The draw phase MUST produce either a resource or event card using a default 70% / 30% weighting; weighting configurable (resource weight 0‚Äì100; event = remainder) at game start.
- **FR-008**: Resource cards MUST include roles (Dev, PM, UX) or wildcard Contractor; each role card MUST have a point value (Senior 3, Junior 2, Entry 1; Contractor 2) as defined.
- **FR-009**: Contractor cards MUST be declared as exactly one role at the moment of feature completion and count only toward that role.
- **FR-010**: Feature completion MUST require meeting or exceeding each listed role threshold simultaneously with a single chosen bundle from the hand.
- **FR-011**: On feature completion the system MUST remove the used resource cards from that player's hand and increment the completed feature total.
- **FR-012**: After completion assign a new feature immediately if deck remains; if exhausted, player has no active feature until game end.
- **FR-013**: A player MUST have at most one active feature at a time.
- **FR-014**: The system MUST allow at most one trade initiation per player per turn (recipient can still initiate their own on their turn).
- **FR-015**: Trades MUST involve exactly two players and MAY consist of an exchange or a one-sided gift.
- **FR-016**: Event: Layoff MUST randomly discard one resource from the triggering player's hand if any; otherwise nullify.
- **FR-017**: Event: Reorg MUST allow the triggering player to select one resource to transfer to another player's hand if possible; otherwise nullify.
- **FR-018**: Event: Company Competition MUST impose a requirement to complete at least one feature on the player's next turn; failing that MUST trigger its penalty at end of that turn.
- **FR-019**: Company Competition penalty MUST remove one previously completed feature chosen by the player; if none exist, discard two random resources (or as many as available if fewer than two).
- **FR-020**: Event: PTO MUST mark a chosen resource as unavailable for the current and the player's next turn; it becomes available after that next turn ends.
- **FR-021**: PTO-marked resources MUST be visually indicated to the owning player and excluded from completion bundles until reactivated.
- **FR-022**: Events MUST affect only the drawing player and must never retroactively alter already completed features (except Company Competition penalty which removes one from the team total explicitly).
- **FR-023**: If an event has no legal effect, it MUST be declared nullified with no state change.
- **FR-024**: The system MUST prevent partial feature progress tracking; either a feature completes atomically or has no progress stored.
- **FR-025**: Multiple completions per turn allowed by default; optional toggle can restrict to one.
- **FR-026**: The system MUST ignore and not carry over excess role points beyond thresholds.
- **FR-027**: Deterministic random sequence when optional seed specified; otherwise generate & reveal seed in end summary.
- **FR-028**: Log significant actions retaining last 100 entries (configurable).
- **FR-029**: The system MUST restrict completion attempts to cards in the player's current hand only (no borrowed temporary resources outside trades).
- **FR-030**: PTO-locked resources are tradable; lock persists with resource under new owner.
- **FR-031**: The system MUST enforce that competition requirement clears immediately upon any feature completion by the affected player during the required turn.
- **FR-032**: The system MUST surface a visible indicator when a player is under a competition requirement.
- **FR-033**: The game MUST present current team progress (completed vs. target) at all times.
- **FR-034**: The system MUST disallow feature completion if any required role threshold would not be met after applying declared Contractor role assignments.
- **FR-035**: The system MUST allow a player to pass their action phase without trading or completing.
- **FR-036**: If a player's hand is empty they MUST still complete the draw phase and may only pass afterward.
- **FR-037**: Removal penalty decrements team total; forfeited feature enters lost pile and never re-enters play.
- **FR-038**: The system MUST ensure that win condition checks happen immediately following any feature completion before further actions.
- **FR-039**: Role color coding supplemented by distinct icons and text labels for accessibility.
- **FR-040**: Actions processed sequentially; no concurrent conflicting actions in MVP.
- **FR-041**: Configurable: draw weighting, multiple completion toggle, RNG seed, log retention size; victory target formula fixed.
- **FR-042**: The system MUST document and expose to players (or host) any optional rule toggles chosen at game start (e.g., single vs multiple completions per turn).
- **FR-043**: The system MUST ensure that feature requirements never include roles outside the defined role set.
- **FR-044**: The system MUST ensure PTO timers decrement correctly and release resources precisely after the owner's next turn ends.
- **FR-045**: The system MUST not allow a player to hold more than one active feature simultaneously. (Reiterated to guarantee enforcement.)
- **FR-046**: End summary includes outcome, turns used, team target, total completed, per-player completed counts, trades initiated, events by type, resources discarded via events, features forfeited, RNG seed.
- **FR-047**: Blocking modal decisions are serialized; completion disabled until resolved.
- **FR-048**: The system MUST treat all random selection of resources (Layoff, penalty discards) as uniformly distributed across eligible cards.
- **FR-049**: Forfeited features reduce progress; any achieved instant win remains final.
- **FR-050**: The system MUST maintain game state integrity so that invalid actions are rejected without state mutation.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Game**: Represents a single cooperative session; tracks turn number, turn limit, target completion threshold, completed feature total, RNG seed, configuration (optional rules), and log.
- **Player**: Participant with an identifier, current hand of resource cards, active feature, completed feature collection, lost (forfeited) feature collection, active competition requirement (if any), PTO locks.
- **Feature Card**: Defines required role thresholds (subset of roles). Attributes: id, title, roleRequirements (role‚Üípoints). State: active, completed, forfeited.
- **Resource Card**: Represents staffing capacity; attributes: id, role (or Contractor), level (Senior/Junior/Entry) or wildcard flag, pointValue, PTO status/timer.
- **Event Card**: One-off effect upon draw: Layoff, Reorg, Company Competition, PTO; attributes: type, parameters (if any), resolution state (nullified vs applied).
- **Deck / Generator**: Feature deck is finite & shuffled at game start; resource & event draws are virtual infinite (generated per weighting each draw).
- **Competition Requirement**: Pending obligation tied to a player with deadline turn reference.
- **PTO Lock**: Temporal restriction object storing resource reference and release turn.
- **Action Log Entry**: Record of significant events for visibility (type, player, timestamp, summary).
