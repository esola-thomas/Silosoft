## Silosoft Digital Cooperative Card Game - Complete Implementation

### MISSION
You are implementing the complete Silosoft digital card game as specified in the comprehensive task list. This is a cooperative workplace-themed card game where 2-4 players collaborate to complete feature projects within 10 rounds by strategically assigning team resources while navigating HR events.

### CRITICAL SPECIFICATIONS TO READ FIRST
**MANDATORY**: Read these files in order before starting any implementation:

1. **`/specs/feat/001-Silosoft-MVP/spec.md`** - Core feature specification with 15 functional requirements
2. **`/specs/feat/001-Silosoft-MVP/plan.md`** - Technical architecture (React + Express + Jest)
3. **`/specs/feat/001-Silosoft-MVP/data-model.md`** - 6 core entities with validation rules and relationships
4. **`/specs/feat/001-Silosoft-MVP/contracts/game-api.yaml`** - Complete OpenAPI specification with 5 endpoints
5. **`/specs/feat/001-Silosoft-MVP/research.md`** - Resolved design decisions and card distributions
6. **`/specs/feat/001-Silosoft-MVP/tasks.md`** - **YOUR IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP** (50 numbered tasks T001-T050)
7. **`/specs/feat/001-Silosoft-MVP/quickstart.md`** - End-to-end validation scenarios
8. **`.specify/memory/constitution.md`** - Constitutional requirements (game-first, simplicity, test-first)

### IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

#### Phase Execution Order (STRICT)
1. **Setup (T001-T006)**: Project structure, dependencies, linting
2. **Tests First (T007-T017)**: Contract tests + integration tests (**MUST FAIL INITIALLY**)
3. **Core Implementation (T018-T031)**: Models â†’ Services â†’ API Endpoints
4. **Integration (T032-T036)**: Express server, middleware, persistence
5. **Frontend (T037-T042)**: React components, game UI
6. **Polish (T043-T050)**: Unit tests, performance, documentation

#### Constitutional Requirements (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- **Game-First**: Every decision supports building a playable game
- **Test-First**: Write failing tests before ANY implementation (T007-T017 before T018+)
- **Simplicity**: Use frameworks directly, no complex patterns
- **Playable After Each Phase**: Game must work end-to-end after each major phase

#### Parallel Task Execution
Tasks marked **[P]** can run simultaneously (different files, no dependencies):
- **All Contract Tests**: T007-T011 together
- **All Integration Tests**: T012-T017 together
- **All Models**: T018-T023 together
- **All Frontend Components**: T037-T041 together

### WORKFLOW PROTOCOLS

#### Review & Safety Checks
- **Run `/review` after every 3-5 task completions**
- **Run `/review` before any major architectural changes**
- **Run `/review` before moving between phases**
- **STOP immediately if `/review` identifies any issues**

#### Commit Strategy
- **Commit after each task completion** with format:
  ```
  feat: T001 - Create web app project structure

  - Created backend/, frontend/, shared/ directories
  - Initialized npm workspaces
  - Added basic package.json files

  ```
- **Commit failing tests immediately** when implementing T007-T017
- **Commit working implementation** when tests pass
- **Run `/review` before each commit**

#### Error Handling
- If any task fails, STOP and run `/review`
- If tests don't fail when they should, STOP and run `/review`
- If constitutional violations detected, STOP and run `/review`
- If unable to complete a task, document blockers and run `/review`

2. Write integration test (T012-T017) â†’ MUST FAIL
3. Run ALL tests â†’ Verify failures
4. Implement models (T018-T023) â†’ Some tests may pass
5. Implement services (T024-T026) â†’ More tests pass
6. Implement endpoints (T027-T031) â†’ All tests PASS
