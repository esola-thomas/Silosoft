- [ ] T046 Performance tests for 10-round game completion in backend/tests/performance/test_game_performance.js
  - Ensure game completes in <5 minutes
  - Measure operation timing for critical game actions
  - Work with **Performance Testing Specialist** for implementation

- [ ] T047 Load testing for concurrent games in backend/tests/performance/test_load.js
  - Test multiple concurrent game sessions
  - Measure server resource usage
  - Work with **Performance Testing Specialist** for scenarios and tools

- [ ] T048 [P] Update API documentation with examples in backend/docs/api.md
  - Include request/response examples for all endpoints
  - Document error scenarios and handling
  - Work with **Project Architect** and **Security Middleware Specialist**

- [ ] T049 Execute quickstart validation scenarios from quickstart.md
  - Run through all 13 test scenarios from quickstart.md
  - Document results and fix any issues
  - Work with **Game Logic Specialist** to ensure game mechanics are correct

- [ ] T050 Code review checklist and cleanup for constitutional compliance
  - Verify all constitutional requirements are met
  - Clean up code, remove TODOs, fix any remaining issues
  - Work with **Project Architect** for final architecture review
  - Consider deployment readiness with **DevOps Deployment Specialist**

### IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

#### Task Prioritization
1. **T045** - Complete frontend component tests first to ensure UI works correctly
2. **T046-T047** - Implement performance tests to identify optimization opportunities
3. **T048** - Update API documentation for developer usability
4. **T049** - Execute validation scenarios to verify end-to-end functionality
5. **T050** - Final code review and cleanup for production readiness

#### Task Parallelization
- T045 (Frontend tests) and T048 (API docs) can be executed in parallel
- T046 (Performance tests) and T047 (Load testing) should be sequential

#### Agent Consultation Strategy
- Consult **Frontend Integration Specialist** before implementing T045
- Consult **Performance Testing Specialist** before implementing T046-T047
- Consult **Project Architect** and **Security Middleware Specialist** for T048
- Consult **Game Logic Specialist** for T049 validation
- Consult all agents for T050 final review

### WORKFLOW PROTOCOLS

#### Testing and Validation
1. **Frontend Tests**: Complete component tests with React Testing Library
2. **Performance Tests**: Measure and optimize critical game operations
3. **Load Tests**: Verify server handles multiple concurrent games
4. **Validation Scenarios**: Execute all scenarios from quickstart.md
5. **Final Review**: Comprehensive code review with all agents

#### Commit Strategy
- **Commit after each task completion** with format:
  ```
  feat: T045 - Complete frontend component unit tests
  
  - Added tests for GameBoard component
  - Added tests for FeatureDisplay component
  - Added tests for App component routing
  - 90% test coverage achieved for frontend components

### COMMAND TO START CLAUDE IMPLEMENTATION
```bash
claude -p "$(cat /home/esola-thomas/silosoft/docs/claude-headless-continue.md)" --output-format json --allowedTools "Bash,Read,Write,Edit,MultiEdit,Grep,Glob,TodoWrite,mcp__playwright__launch_browser,mcp__playwright__navigate,mcp__playwright__screenshot,mcp__context7__resolve_library,mcp__context7__fetch_docs" --mcp-config /home/esola-thomas/silosoft/.mcp.json --permission-mode acceptEdits --append-system-prompt "You MUST run '/review' after every 3-5 task completions and before any major changes. You MUST commit changes after each task completion. You MUST follow the exact task sequence T001-T050 from tasks.md. This branch will become a PR - keep commits clean and focused. Use Context7 for latest documentation and Playwright for UI testing." --verbose
```

### START IMPLEMENTATION
Begin with T045 (completing frontend component tests) and consult with the Frontend Integration Specialist first. Then proceed through the remaining tasks in order of priority. Remember to run `/review` frequently, commit after each task completion, and consult with the specialized agents as needed.
