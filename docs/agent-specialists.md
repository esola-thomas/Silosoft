- **Observability**: Maintain clear state visibility and debugging capabilities

## Getting Started

1. **Identify the task type** using the guidelines above
2. **Select the appropriate specialist** based on domain expertise
3. **Invoke the agent** with a clear, specific request
4. **Provide context** about the current game development phase
5. **Let the specialist** apply their domain expertise with built-in tools

---

**For Support**: Agents are designed to work autonomously with minimal guidance
**Best Practice**: Use the most specific agent for each task rather than general-purpose approaches
**Performance**: Specialists complete tasks faster and with higher quality than generic agents
